# DataDigger

Brief description or introduction of your project. Mention what it does and why it's useful. <br/>
In this project I created a website where you can scrape data from Amazon, and check when it is most profitable for us to buy a product. <br/>
At first we will copy the url to the search bar, and after the site finds the product, we will have to write our email in a popup box.<br/>
When the product drops in price, we will receive an update directly to your email!<br/>
In addition, you can see all the product details on its card
